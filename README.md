How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- Interpretting user needs involves deciphering what's needed in the software to solve the issues users bring up. Creating User Stories provides actionable items based on the user's needs to reference throughout development.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- Normally I approach development on a task by task basis, meaning I will split a proejct up into items that can be completed one at aa time. I will definetly involve a process similar to user stories to keep these tasks organized.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
- In a Scrum team, transparency from each team member is critically important. This means they have to be clear on whatver roadblocks they are coming up against, be open about what tasks they have completed, and communicate what they plan to work on.
